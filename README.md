IPL Data Analysis (2008-2017)
Project Overview
This project is a deep-dive data analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) from the seasons spanning 2008 to 2017. The primary goal was to transform raw cricket data into actionable insights using powerful data cleaning and visualization techniques. The analysis covers a wide range of topics, including team and player performance, match trends, and venue dynamics, culminating in an interactive dashboard for easy exploration.

Tools and Technologies
Data Cleaning & Analysis: Python

Data Visualization: Power BI, Tableau

Datasets
The analysis was performed using two core datasets:

matches.csv: This dataset contains high-level match information for all 636 matches played between 2008 and 2017.

Key Columns: id, season, city, date, team1, team2, toss_winner, toss_decision, winner, player_of_match, and more.

deliveries.csv: This dataset provides granular, ball-by-ball information for every delivery bowled in the tournament.

Key Columns: match_id, inning, batting_team, bowling_team, over, ball, batsman, bowler, batsman_runs, total_runs, and player_dismissed.

Key Findings & Insights
The interactive dashboard created from this analysis reveals several key insights:

The Toss Advantage: A clear historical trend shows that winning the toss and choosing to field first has given teams a significant edge.

Dominant Teams & Players: The analysis identifies the most successful teams of the decade based on win-loss records and highlights top individual performers based on runs, wickets, and "Man of the Match" awards.

Venue Dynamics: The data demonstrates how different venues impact match outcomes, with some stadiums consistently favoring batsmen while others offer a more favorable environment for bowlers.

Project Deliverables
Interactive Dashboard: A comprehensive dashboard (built in Power BI or Tableau) providing an interactive way to explore the data.

Project Report: A summary report detailing the analysis process, key findings, and conclusions.
